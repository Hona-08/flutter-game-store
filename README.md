Flutter Games is an app for purchasing and renting games. This demo app is my first adventure in Flutter and I have to say its been a blast!

# Flutter is Amazing

A quick list of what I found makes Flutter great:

* **Views are code.** Much less boilerplate than having adapters, viewholders, and XML all over the place.
* **Hero shared element transitions.** Just wrap shared elements in a Hero widget and give them the same tag to created a shared transition. No need to read 3 pages of documentation and write tightly coupled code :) This is truly mindblowing. 
* **Graceful image loading.** Flutter understands that visible images should be loaded first. The way Flutter does image loading in a List is just so beautiful!
* **Highly customizable button content positioning.** On Android, Buttons aren't very well designed. 'drawableLeft' and 'drawableRight' have very awkward and difficult to customize positioning. Flutter gives you full control over the positioning of items in your button.
* **Minimal dependencies.** Flutter comes with so much out of the box. This entire app was built without any external dependencies! (cupertino icons doesn't count :P)

# Flutter Wishlist

Flutter is very new so there are some features and libraries missing that would make development much better. Here are some of those missing components I would have liked to use:

---

>Image Gallery ✔️

Something to view images with. Android doesn't have a good image viewing library either (sigh).

**UPDATE:** https://github.com/tinylife-io/flutter_scroll_gallery

>Change Button's Inner Contents on Press

There's no way to set text/icon color when a button is pressed. This lack of functionality really limits the range of buttons one can create.

>Video Player ✔️

Something to play trailer videos or just videos in general.

**UPDATE:** https://github.com/brianegan/chewie

---

If any of the above now exists, please let me know.
